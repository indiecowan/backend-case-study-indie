# WHCC Backend/API Engineer Case Study
Create a **private** [mirror copy](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/duplicating-a-repository#mirroring-a-repository) of this repo in your own Github account.

Please add your WHCC contact to that repo as a collaborator when you're done.

The purpose of this case study is for us to better understand where your technical expertise is at.

# Description
Create an application that accepts an amount of money (USD) as input, and returns a set of coins that add up to that amount.
The algorithm should optimize for the fewest number of coins.

The following coins are allowed - dollar coin, quarter, dime, nickel, and penny. Use a language of your choice, and feel free to use libraries that support the goal.

When youâ€™re satisfied with your solution, provide a link to a repository and instructions to build and run the code. Try to timebox the work to approximately 60 minutes.

DIRECTIONS TO RUN:
Started at 6pm 1/17/23 ended 7pm 1/17/23 PCT.
To run through command line download all java files and run ComLineChange with 1 command line argument, money (in double format). You may also run the tests I was doing by running ChangeFinder.

Thank you so much for this opportunity! I look forward to talking further :)

# Discussion Notes
1. What decisions did you make before you began development?
1. How did you decide what to work on in order to meet the time constraint?
1. What was your decision making process for your code organization?
1. If you had more time, what would you have implemented?
